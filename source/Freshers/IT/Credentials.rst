Your SSO and RASSO
==============================================

SSO (Single Sign-On)
****************************************************************

Your SSO is your most important online account. It is used to access most of your online services, including your e-mail, and should never be shared with others.

You will be sent your SSO details via e-mail a few weeks after you've filled out your University Card Form. If you do not receive your SSO details, contact the `Computer Office. <mailto:computer.office@bnc.ox.ac.uk>`_

Your SSO user-name will be displayed in the format "bras####@ox.ac.uk", ie, "bras2345@ox.ac.uk". It is different from your public university e-mail address, although you use it to log-in to your e-mail, and it must be kept secret.

**For security reasons, your SSO is not used for external services, such as UPay. Therefore, you must not type in your SSO user-name or password unless the URL of the log-in page is "https://login.microsoftonline.com/"**

**It is important that you set-up Two Factor Authentication once you have access to your SSO.**

RASSO (Remote Access Single Sign-On)
****************************************************************

Your RASSO is used to log-into Eduroam and the University VPN. You can generate your RASSO via `the online portal <https://register.it.ox.ac.uk>`_, which you will need to log-in to using your SSO.

You can reset your RASSO password at any time using the portal.

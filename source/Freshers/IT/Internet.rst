Connecting to The Internet
==============================================

There are three ways for students to access the internet at Brasenose College:

* Through a Wired Connection,
* Through the College WiFi, and
* Through the University WiFi.

The Wired Connection provides the fastest connection and works reliably, so long as your computer supports it.

The College WiFi is called BrasenoseWiFi and works reliably in all cases, but only within Brasenose.

The University WiFi is called Eduroam works across all university sites, but it is slow and you can not access services such as printing without additional setup. It is also complicated to set-up.

**You will need access to your university SSO (Single Sign On) to connect to the internet. If you do not have an SSO, refer to the SSO section of The Fresher's Guide to IT for help.**

Wired Connection
********************************

To connect to the wired network, you must register your device, which will link your internet access to your SSO account.

Before registering your device, you must determine its unique MAC address, which is used to identify the device when it connects to the network. `Click here for a guide to finding your device's MAC address. <https://it.brasenose.org/network/wired-network/#find-mac-address>`_

You can register your device in one of two ways:

* By following the instructions on `the online portal <https://www.bnc.ox.ac.uk/MyNetwork>`_. When prompted, log-in using your "University of Oxford Single Sign On", and enter your MAC address when required.
* If you are at Brasenose, by connecting to the network named "BNC-Onboarding". When prompted, log-in using your "University of Oxford Single Sign-On", and enter your MAC address when required. Then, remove the BNC-Onboarding WiFi network from your device (ie, 'forget' the network). 

Once you have registered, you will be able to access the internet via your room's Ethernet Port. If you can not find your Ethernet Port or have any further questions, contact the `Computer Office. <mailto:computer.office@bnc.ox.ac.uk>`_

BrasenoseWiFi
********************************

Each user accesses BrasenoseWiFi with their own unique password, which they must obtain before attempting to connect to the network.

Your unique password, which you should never share under any circumstances, can be accessed in one of two ways:

* By following the instructions on `the online portal <https://www.bnc.ox.ac.uk/MyNetwork>`_. When prompted, log-in using your "University of Oxford Single Sign On". By following the instructions on the page, obtain the WiFi key.
* If you are at Brasenose, by connecting to the network named "BNC-Onboarding". When prompted, log-in using your "University of Oxford Single Sign-On". By following the instructions on the page, obtain the WiFi key. Then, remove the BNC-Onboarding WiFi network from your device (ie, 'forget' the network). 

Once you have obtained your unique password, use it to sign-in to the network named "BrasenoseWiFi".

**If there is poor WiFi reception in your area, ask the Computer Office for help.**

University WiFi (Eduroam)
********************************

Eduroam is rather difficult to connect to manually, therefore we recommend that you use a piece of software called the "CAT" to set it up for you. `Click here to access the CAT. <https://cat.eduroam.org/?idp=191>`_

After downloading and installing the CAT from the link provided, follow the on-screen instructions to sign-into Eduroam using your RASSO.

**Your RASSO is different from your SSO. If you do not have a RASSO, refer to the RASSO section of The Fresher's Guide to IT for help.**

WiFi for Guests
********************************

Access to Brasenose's guest WiFi can only be obtained by contacting the Porter's Lodge.

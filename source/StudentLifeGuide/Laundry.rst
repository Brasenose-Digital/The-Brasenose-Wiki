Laundry at Brasenose
==============================================

All Brasenose College sites, including the Frewin Annexe and Holly Bush Row, are equipped with a Laundry Room. Within each Laundry Room, there is a set of washers and dryers that are shared among the residents of that site.

You must pay to operate a laundry machine at the point of use. Contactless cards, Apple Pay and Google Pay are the only possible means of payment.

You are always expected to supply the machines with your own detergent, liquid laundry pods, etc.

Ironing
****************************************************************

Typical clothing irons are considered to be a fire hazard by the College and are prohibited in most areas of the college. There are free-to-use irons and ironing boards in the Laundry Room.

We recommend that you purchase a handheld steamer, as it fulfils the same purpose as an iron but can be kept and used in your room.

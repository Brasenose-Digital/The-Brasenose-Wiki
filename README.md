# The Brasenose Wiki

This is the unofficial student wiki for Brasenose College, Oxford.

## The Purpose of This Wiki

Crucial information about how business is conducted within Brasenose College is scattered across multiple web-pages, thus the realities of college life are opaque to external observers. Further, the lack of a unified “Getting Started at Brasenose Guide” results in an environment that is difficult for freshers to navigate.

The Brasenose Wiki provides current and prospective students of Brasenose College with accurate, up-to-date information on all matters surrounding the college, thereby making life easier for incoming students.
